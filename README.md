## Data files
- `995,000_rows.csv` is the full dataset and is available on Absalon.
- `995,000_rows_preprocessed.csv` is the full preprocessed dataset and will be available on Dropbox. Alternatively you can run the preprocessing code on the full dataset and create the preprocessed dataset locally. It will take approximately two hours.
- `10,000_rows.csv` is a large sample of the full dataset that can be used when we want to run our preprocessing pipeline on a dataset of decent size, but we do not want it to take hours to run. 
- `10,000_rows.csv` is a preprocessed sample of the full dataset that can be used when we want to work with the preprocessed data, but the preprocessed full dataset is too heavy.
- `250_rows.csv` is a small sample of the full dataset that is used for part 1, task 1.

## Other files
- `preprocessing.pdf` is the output of the preprocessing pipeline runned on the full dataset.
